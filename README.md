the site always keeps users informed of where they are on the page and enables their users to have control over their actions on the site.

## 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
	Always keep users informed about what is going on.
	Provide appropriate feedback within reasonable time. 
  ### Amazon
   Amazon does not have any issues with this heuristic for the following reasons:\
   • On any screen, Amazon shows users how many items they have in their cart, informing users that items were successfully added to their cart and keeping users informed on how items they have saved and intend on buying. \
  • When viewing items in the cart, Amazon provides the total price of the user's entire purchase as well as how many total items the user plans on purchasing as well, informing the user about the summary of his or her purchase. \
  • After the user adds an item into their cart, the user is taken to another screen where it displays a confirmation that the item was successfully added to the cart. This clearly shows the user that their request went through. \
  • When checking out, Amazon makes it clear that the user is in the check out area and no longer in their cart by bringing the user into a separate, isolated screen where the user can input their address and checkout information. This clear differentiation between the cart and checkout area communicates to the user that, when in the checkout area, their private information is being protected and that they are about to make a purchase.
  ### Coursicle
  Coursicle does not have any issues with this heuristic for the following reasons:
  
## 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
	Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
	Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

## 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
	Users often choose system functions by mistake.
	Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
	Support undo and redo.

## 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
	Follow platform conventions. 
  ### Amazon
  • When trying to add an item to a wedding directory, for some items, the option to add to the wedding directory is not available. If Amazon is giving the option to add certain items to a wedding directory, this option should be available consistently to all items. Another way to solve this issue is allowing the user to select an option in their settings that allows them to show the wedding directory option on each item they view or to not include the option at all. 
  • After searching for an item on Amazon, sometimes the list of items are listed in strips, but other times the items are listed in a grid pattern. This causes inconsistency with how items are listed and can cause confusion for users. In order to improve this heuristic, Amazon should choose one type of list display and use the same display for every item search.

## 5. ERROR PREVENTION
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DAIGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
	Even though it is better if the system can be used without documentation, it may be necessary to provide help and documentation. 
	Help  information should be easy to search, focused on the user's task, list concrete steps to be carried out, and not be too large.
