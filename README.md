INSERT INTRO STUFF HERE
the site always keeps users informed of where they are on the page and enables their users to have control over their actions on the site.

## 1. VISIBILITY OF SYSTEM STATUS
  ### Amazon
   Amazon does not have any issues with this heuristic for the following reasons:\
   • On any screen, Amazon shows users how many items they have in their cart, informing users that items were successfully added to their cart and keeping users informed on how items they have saved and intend on buying. \
  • When viewing items in the cart, Amazon provides the total price of the user's entire purchase as well as how many total items the user plans on purchasing as well, informing the user about the summary of his or her purchase. \
  • After the user adds an item into their cart, the user is taken to another screen where it displays a confirmation that the item was successfully added to the cart. This clearly shows the user that their request went through. \
  • When checking out, Amazon makes it clear that the user is in the check out area and no longer in their cart by bringing the user into a separate, isolated screen where the user can input their address and checkout information. This clear differentiation between the cart and checkout area communicates to the user that, when in the checkout area, their private information is being protected and that they are about to make a purchase.
  ### Coursicle
  • When browsing for classes, Coursicle does not show readers which schedule they are on (users can create multiple schedules). This does not keep users informed on which schedule they are adding classes to. This can cause users to add classes to the wrong schedule and have less control and knowledge over their scheduling. Coursicle should add text displaying which schedule they are browsing and adding classes to at the top of every screen so that they constantly know which schedule they are on. (1)\
  • However, coursicle does show users which screen they are on (the browse screen or the schedule screen) at all times. This properly informs users which interface they are on and allows them to easily switch between both screens. No issues or improvements are needed for this.\
  • In addition, when a searched class has a time conflict with an already scheduled class, Coursicle visibly fades the color of the new class so users know not to schedule it in. This informs users about what is already on their schedule and which classes they can or can not add in order to prevent class time conflicts. No issues or improvements are needed for this.\
  
## 2. MATCH BETWEEN SYSTEM AND THE REAL WORLD
	Speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. 
	Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. 
  ### Amazon
  Amazon does not have any issues with this heuristic for the following reasons:
  ### Coursicle
  
## 3. USER CONTROL AND FREEDOM
	Users often choose system functions by mistake.
	Provide a clearly marked "out" to leave an unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. 
	Support undo and redo.

  ### Coursicle
  
## 4. CONSISTENCY AND STANDARDS
	Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. 
	Follow platform conventions. 
  ### Amazon
  • When trying to add an item to a wedding directory, for some items, the option to add to the wedding directory is not available. If Amazon is giving the option to add certain items to a wedding directory, this option should be available consistently to all items. Another way to solve this issue is allowing the user to select an option in their settings that allows them to show the wedding directory option on each item they view or to not include the option at all.(3)\
  • After searching for an item on Amazon, sometimes the list of items are listed in strips, but other times the items are listed in a grid pattern. This causes inconsistency with how items are listed and can cause confusion for users. In order to improve this heuristic, Amazon should choose one type of list display and use the same display for every item search.(3)\
 
  ### Coursicle
  
## 5. ERROR PREVENTION
	Even better than good error messages is a careful design which prevents a problem from occurring in the first place. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 6. RECOGNITION RATHER THAN RECALL
	Make objects, actions, and options visible. 
	User should not have to remember information from one part of the dialogue to another. 
	Instructions for use of the system should be visible or easily retrievable whenever appropriate. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 7. FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF USE
	Accelerators -- unseen by the novice user -- may often speed up the interaction for the expert user so that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. 
	Allow users to tailor frequent actions. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 8. AESTHETIC AND MINIMALIST DESIGN
	Dialogues should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. 
	Every extra unit of information in a dialogue competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. 
  ### Amazon
  ### Coursicle
  
## 9. HELP USERS RECOGNIZE, DAIGNOSE, AND RECOVER FROM ERRORS
	Expressed in plain language (no codes)
	Precisely indicate the problem
	Constructively suggest a solution.

## 10. HELP AND DOCUMENTATION
  ### Amazon
  • While Amazon's "Help" page is easy to navigate, in which help information is easy to search and Amazon provides direct links to sites or functions that bring the user directly to pages that navigate the user through specific steps to carry out their tasks, the "Help" button is hard to find. It is located at bottom right of the footer on every screen in small text, surrounded by other functions as well. In order to make this function more visible and easy to find, Amazon should put a help icon ('?') at the top of the site on the header so it will be accessible from every interface.(2)\
  ### Coursicle
  • Coursicle does not have a help feature or page at all. This makes it impossible for Coursicle to provide solutions to users who are unfamiliar at navigating through the site. I suggest that Coursicle add a visible and easy-access help feature on their site's top dashboard that users can click to search for help on specific features on Coursicle.(1)\
